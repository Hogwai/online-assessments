# SQL: Calculating Month Over Month % Growth Rate

## Instructions
### Task

Given a posts table that contains a created_at timestamp column write a query that returns a first date of the month, a number of posts created in a given month and a month-over-month growth rate.

The resulting set should be ordered chronologically by date.

Note:

    percent growth rate can be negative
    percent growth rate should be rounded to one digit after the decimal point and immediately followed by a percent symbol "%". See the desired output below for the reference.

#### Desired Output

The resulting set should look similar to the following:

| date | count | percent_growth |
|------|-------|----------------|
|2016-02-01 |   175 |           null|
|2016-03-01 |   338 |          93.1%|
|2016-04-01 |   345 |           2.1%|
|2016-05-01 |   295 |         -14.5%|
|2016-06-01 |   330 |          11.9%|
...


    date - (DATE) a first date of the month
    count - (INT) a number of posts in a given month
    percent_growth - (TEXT) a month-over-month growth rate expressed in percents
