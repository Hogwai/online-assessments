# Angular Generate Username


We provided some simple Angular template code. 
Your goal is to add 2 input forms in the component for first name and last name. 

Once both forms are filled out by the user and the "Generate" button is clicked, then next to the button a username should be automatically generated which should be in the following format: [firstname]_[lastname]_[random integer]. 

First name and last name should be lowercased, and then a random integer between 1 and 9 should be added to the end. For example: if the inputs are "Daniel" and "SMITH" the generated username could be "daniel_smith_4" or "daniel_smith_2".

When your application loads, the input fields should be prepopulated with the following values already:

First name = Coder
Last name = Byte

You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the element ID's as they are. 
Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.
